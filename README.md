Wordle Project (Comp 3450 Project 2) by Trevor Luttrell

This project will take in a five-letter word from the user.
It will then clear the screen and allow a different (Or same) user to guess the word.
It will highlight letters in GREEN that are in the word and in the correct spot.
It will highlight letters in YELLOW that are in the word.
It will highlight letters in GREY that are not in the word.
The user will get six attempts at guessing.
The game will end once the user guesses the word or runs out of attemps.

Enjoy :)
